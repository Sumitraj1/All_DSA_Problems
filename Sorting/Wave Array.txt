Given a sorted array arr[] of distinct integers. Sort the array into a wave-like array(In Place).
In other words, arrange the elements into a sequence such that arr[1] >= arr[2] <= arr[3] >= arr[4] <= arr[5].....

If there are multiple solutions, find the lexicographically smallest one.

Note:The given array is sorted in ascending order, and you don't need to return anything to make changes in the original array itself.

Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
Output: 2 1 4 3 5
Explanation: Array elements after 
sorting it in wave form are 
2 1 4 3 5.



class Solution {
    public static void convertToWave(int n, int[] a) {
        // code here
         for(int i=0;i<a.length-1;i=i+2){
            int temp=a[i];
            a[i]=a[i+1];
            a[i+1]=temp;
         }
    }
}
