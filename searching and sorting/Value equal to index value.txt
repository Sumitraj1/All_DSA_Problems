Given an array Arr of N positive integers. Your task is to find the elements whose value is equal to that of its index value ( Consider 1-based indexing ).

Note: There can be more than one element in the array which have the same value as its index. You need to include every such element's index. Follows 1-based indexing of the array.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 5
Arr[] = {15, 2, 45, 12, 7}
Output: 2
Explanation: Only Arr[2] = 2 exists here.


class Solution {
    ArrayList<Integer> valueEqualToIndex(int arr[], int n) {
        // code here
         ArrayList<Integer> arr1 = new ArrayList<>();
        if(n==0){
            return arr1;
        }
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            if(arr[i] == (i+1)){
                arr1.add(i+1);
            }
        }
        return arr1;
    }
}
