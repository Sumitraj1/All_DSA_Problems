Given an array arr[] denoting heights of N towers and a positive integer K, you have to modify the height of each tower either by increasing or decreasing them by K only once.
Find out what could be the possible minimum difference of the height of shortest and longest towers after you have modified each tower.
Note: Assume that height of the tower can be negative.
A slight modification of the problem can be found here. 


class Solution {
    int getMinDiff(int[] arr, int n, int k) {
        // code here
         if(n==1) return 0;
     Arrays.sort(arr);
     int diff=arr[n-1]-arr[0];
     int max;
     int min;
     
     for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
         max=Math.max(arr[i-1]+k,arr[n-1]-k);
         min=Math.min(arr[0]+k,arr[i]-k);
         diff=Math.min(diff,max-min);
     }
     return diff;
    }
}
