Given an array arr[] of size N and an element k. The task is to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 8
arr[] = {3,1,2,2,1,2,3,3}
k = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and
 2 are the only elements that appears 
more than n/k times.
Example 2:

Input:
N = 4
arr[] = {2,3,3,2}
k = 3
Output: 2
Explanation: In the given array, 3 and 2 
are the only elements that appears more 
than n/k times. So the count of elements 
are 2.





class Solution 
{
    //Function to find all elements in array that appear more than n/k times.
    public int countOccurence(int[] arr, int n, int k) 
    {
        // your code here,return the answer
         HashMap<Integer,Integer> map=new HashMap<>();
        int count=0;
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            map.put(arr[i],map.getOrDefault(arr[i],0)+1);
        }
        for(Integer i:map.keySet()){
            if(map.get(i)>(n/k)){
                count++;
            }
        }
        return count;
    }
}
