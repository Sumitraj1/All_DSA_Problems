Given two strings s1 and s2. The task is to check if s2 is a rotated version of the string s1. The characters in the strings are in lowercase.

 

Example 1:

Input:
geeksforgeeks
forgeeksgeeks
Output: 
1
Explanation: s1 is geeksforgeeks, s2 is
forgeeksgeeks. Clearly, s2 is a rotated
version of s1 as s2 can be obtained by
left-rotating s1 by 5 units.
 

Example 2:

Input:
mightandmagic
andmagicmigth
Output: 
0
Explanation: Here with any amount of
rotation s2 can't be obtained by s1.

class Solution
{
    //Function to check if two strings are rotations of each other or not.
    public static boolean areRotations(String s1, String s2 )
    {
        // Your code here 
        String str = s1+s1;
        int len1=s1.length();
        int len2=s2.length();
        if(len1!=len2)return false;
        if(str.contains(s2))return true;
        return false;
    }
    
}
