A celebrity is a person who is known to all but does not know anyone at a party. If you go to a party of N people, find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
A square NxN matrix M[][] is used to represent people at the party such that if an element of row i and column j  is set to 1 it means ith person knows jth person. Here M[i][i] will always be 0.
Note: Follow 0 based indexing.
Follow Up: Can you optimize it to O(N)
 

Example 1:

Input:
N = 3
M[][] = {{0 1 0},
         {0 0 0}, 
         {0 1 0}}
Output: 1
Explanation: 0th and 2nd person both
know 1. Therefore, 1 is the celebrity. 

class Solution
{ 
    //Function to find if there is a celebrity in the party or not.
    int celebrity(int M[][], int n)
    {
    	// code here7
    	
    	int c=0;
    	for(int i=1;i<n;i++){
    	    if(M[c][i]==1){
    	        c=i;
    	    }
    	}
    	for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
    	    if(c!=i && (M[c][i]==1 || M[i][c]==0)){
    	        return -1;
    	    }
    	}
    	return c;
    	
    }
}
