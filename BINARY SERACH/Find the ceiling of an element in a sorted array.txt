Problem Statement
Given a sorted array and a and a value x, find the ceiling of x in the array. The ceiling of x is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to x. Output 1 if the ceiling doesn’t exist.

Example 1

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 9, 15, 15, 18, 21}, x = 0
Output : 1
1 is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to 5.
Example 2

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 9, 15, 15, 18, 21}, x = 1
Output : 1
1 is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to 1.
Example 3:

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 9, 15, 15, 18, 21}, x = 5
Output : 9
9 is the smallest element in the array greater than or equal to 5.
Example 4:

Input : a[] = {1, 3, 9, 15, 15, 18, 21}, x = 25
Output : -1
Ceiling doesn't exist

Find the ceiling of an element in a sorted array using Binary Search
Given that the array is sorted, we can apply binary search to find the ceiling of the element. Let’s look at the implementation:

import java.util.Scanner;

class CeilOfElementInSortedArray {
    private static int findCeilBinarySearch(int[] a, int x) {
        int n = a.length;
        int start = 0;
        int end = n-1;

        int ceil = -1;

        while(start <= end) {
            int mid = (start+end)/2;

            if(x == a[mid]) {
                // a[mid] is the ceiling
                return a[mid];
            } else if (x < a[mid]) {
                // a[mid] is the smallest element found so far that is greater than x. So it is a candidate for the ceiling of x
                ceil = a[mid];
                end = mid-1;
            } else {
                start = mid+1;
            }
        }

        return ceil;
    }

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        Scanner keyboard = new Scanner(System.in);
        int n = keyboard.nextInt();
        int[] a = new int[n];
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
          a[i] = keyboard.nextInt(); 
        }
        int x = keyboard.nextInt();
        keyboard.close();

        System.out.printf("Ceil(%d) = %d%n", x, findCeilBinarySearch(a, x));
    }
}
