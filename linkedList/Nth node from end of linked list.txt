Given a linked list consisting of L nodes and given a number N. The task is to find the Nth node from the end of the linked list.

Example 1:

Input:
N = 2
LinkedList: 1->2->3->4->5->6->7->8->9
Output: 8
Explanation: In the first example, there
are 9 nodes in linked list and we need
to find 2nd node from end. 2nd node
from end is 8.  

class Solution
{
    //Function to find the data of nth node from the end of a linked list.
    int getNthFromLast(Node head, int n)
    {
    	// Your code here	
    	Node slow=head;
    	Node fast=head;
    	int temp=n;
    	while(temp-->1){
    	     if(fast==null||fast.next==null){
    	         return -1;
    	     } 
    	    fast=fast.next;
    	}
    	while(fast.next!=null && fast!=null){
    	    slow=slow.next;
    	    fast=fast.next;
    	    
    	}
    	return slow.data;
    }
}
